# pdxcg-intro-course
These are my labs from PDX Code Guild's free introductory Python course in January 2020. The course was 3 hours per day for 3 days per week, totaling 18 hours of combined instruction and lab time across 2 weeks. All these solutions were originally written during classtime in Python 3.

* You can do these labs yourself if you want to practice Python without taking the course. The lab requirements are all freely available on PDX Code Guild's github at https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/IntroToProgramming/tree/master/labs
* If you are in the Portland area and interested in a free Python course, this course's details can be viewed at https://pdxcodeguild.com/pdx_code_guild_intro_courses/

I took this class to learn about the PDX Code Guild, keep my skills sharp by practicing a language I hadn't learned before, and because I enjoy a focused, classroom setting when I learn. Python's syntax is very different from PHP and C-like languages, and having it spelled out by an instructor was certainly helpful. Even so, language grammar is something I could have looked up - the benefit for me was mostly dedicating 3 hours of my evenings to coding against stepped lab problems in a focused environment with an instructor able to provide feedback.

As for the quality of instruction, the instructor and the TAs were gracious with my questions and generous in their feedback. Even so, googling questions about syntax or language features myself was usually the easiest way to progress through the labs. As for the content, the labs felt pretty well geared to graduated instruction in the language. Overall I can recommend the course as a good way to cover the basics of programming and Python for a beginner or an intermediate programmer unfamiliar with the language.
