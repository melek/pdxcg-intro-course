These my labs from PDX Code Guild's free 2-week introductory Python course.

The course can be viewed at https://pdxcodeguild.com/pdx_code_guild_intro_courses/

Coming from PHP and more distantly C-like languages, having Python spelled out by an instructor has been helpful. Even so, the benefit for me has mostly been having a 3 hour part of my day carved out and dedicated to coding against stepped lab problems in a focused setting. The labs seem pretty well geared to graduated instruction in a language. 

As for the quality of instruction, while googling a language structure I'm not familiar with is still my mainstay during classtime the instructor and the TAs have been gracious with my questions and generous in their feedback.
